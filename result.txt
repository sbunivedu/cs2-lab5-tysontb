This program simulates a ticket system where the customers are arriving in
a queue to be served by the cashiers. The constants are the processing
time, maximum cashiers, and the number of customers. The max number
of cashiers is 10 and from 1 to 10 there is a varying average time for the
customers. The process times are initialized and this enqueues the 
customers based on their arrival times. As the customers are processed
the program will calculate their departure time and track the total
time spent. The output will show the amount of cashiers, the avg
time customers spent waiting.
